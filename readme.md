# glopi
An easy interface for the api for GitKraken Glo, kinda like Trello.

## Installation
Requires python3 to be installed and the pip module `pyautogui`. It also requires you to have Firefox installed and in your path (it should be normally). You have to be already logged in Firefox already. You can run `requirements.sh` to check / install requirements (not including firefox).
